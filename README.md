<h1 align="center">OrgAI</h1>

OrgAI is a Python AI Program created to suggest organizations at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a> based upon defined keywords. Using Selenium Browser Automation, OrgAI accesses Purdue's Organization Directory, <a href="https://boilerlink.purdue.edu">Boilerlink</a> and processes the site's language data. Each unique word presented by organization descriptions is rated based upon the frequency it is used within the directory and a weight value generated as users make decisions. Data is continuously developed for suggestion accuracy as users rank organizations on a floating point scale of 0 to 1 based upon their interest.
